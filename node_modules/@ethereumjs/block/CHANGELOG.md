## 3.3.0 - 2021-05-26

### London HF Support

This `Block` release comes with full support for the `london` hardfork. Please note that the default HF is still set to `istanbul`. You therefore need to explicitly set the `hardfork` parameter for instantiating a `Common` instance with a `london` HF activated:

```typescript
import { Block } from 'ethereumjs-block'
import Common from '@ethereumjs/common'
const common = new Common({ chain: 'mainnet', hardfork: 'london' })
const block = Block.fromBlockData({
  header: {
    //...,
    baseFeePerGas: new BN(10),
  }
}, { common })
```

#### EIP-1559: Fee market change for ETH 1.0 chain

This library now supports block structure and related logic coming with the new fee market mechanism introduced by [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559), see PR [#1148](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1148).

Blocks now have an extra `baseFeePerGas` field which can be passed in on instantiation with a `london` (or `EIP-1559`) enabled `common` (otherwise `baseFeePerGas` will default to `new BN(7)`, which is the minimum possible `baseFeePerGas` value).

A block can now also encompass `FeeMarketEIP1559Transaction` txs (type `2`) which are supported by `@ethereumjs/tx` `v3.2.0` or higher. `Transaction` legacy txs (internal type `0`) and `AccessListEIP2930Transaction` txs (type `1`) are still valid.

On block (header) validation with `BlockHeader.validate()` there is a new validity check if the base fee of a block matches the expected calculated base fee derived from the gas used in the parent block and taking the former virtual gas target (gas limit // ELASTICITY_MULTIPLIER (2)) into account.

#### EIP-3554: Difficulty Bomb Delay to December 2021

Support for the `london` difficulty bomb ([EIP-3554](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3554)) delay has been added along PR [#1245](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1245). A `london`-activated block is now doing difficulty calculation and validation with the updated EIP parameters (only PoW chains).

## 3.2.1 - 2021-04-09

- Fixed `BlockData` interface `transactions` typing for EIP-2930 typed txs, PR [#1185](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1185)

## 3.2.0 - 2021-03-18

### Berlin HF Support

This release gets the `Block` library ready for the `berlin` HF by adding support for [EIP2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) Typed Transactions. Transaction objects are now created with the new `TransactionFactory` introduced with the `@ethereumjs/tx` `v3.1.0` release which chooses the correct tx type for the data. The initial tx release supports the old legacy transactions and the newly added [EIP2930](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930) Access List Transaction Type, see PR [#1048](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1048).

Please note that the default HF is still set to `istanbul`. You therefore need to explicitly set the `hardfork` parameter for instantiating a `Block` instance with a `berlin` HF activated:

```typescript
import { Block } from 'ethereumjs-block'
import Common from '@ethereumjs/common'
const common = new Common({ chain: 'mainnet', hardfork: 'berlin' })
const block = Block.fromBlockData({}, { common })
```

#### EthereumJS Libraries - Typed Transactions Readiness

If you are using this library in conjunction with other EthereumJS libraries make sure to minimally have the following library versions installed for typed transaction support:

- `@ethereumjs/common` `v2.2.0`
- `@ethereumjs/tx` `v3.1.0`
- `@ethereumjs/block` `v3.2.0`
- `@ethereumjs/blockchain` `v5.2.0`
- `@ethereumjs/vm` `v5.2.0`

### Other Changes

- Added support for very large chain IDs when using Block `cliqueSigner()` address recovery, PR [#1139](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1139)
- Fixed a TS compilation failure on install relating to `ethereumjs-util` `v7.0.9`, PR [#1136](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1136)

## 3.1.0 - 2021-02-22

### Clique/PoA Support

This release introduces Clique/PoA support for the `Block` library, see the main PR [#1032](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1032) as well as the follow-up PRs [#1074](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1074) and PR [#1088](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1088). The `BlockHeader.validate()` function now properly validates the various Clique/PoA-specific properties (`extraData` checks and others, see API documentation) and `BlockHeader.validateConsensus()` can be used to properly validate that a Clique/PoA block has the correct signature.

For sealing a block on instantiation there is a new `cliqueSigner` constructor option:

```typescript
const cliqueSigner = Buffer.from('PRIVATE_KEY_HEX_STRING', 'hex')
const block = Block.fromHeaderData(headerData, { cliqueSigner })
```

Additionally there are the following new utility methods for Clique/PoA related functionality in the `BlockHeader` class:

- `BlockHeader.validateCliqueDifficulty(blockchain: Blockchain): boolean`
- `BlockHeader.cliqueSigHash()`
- `BlockHeader.cliqueIsEpochTransition(): boolean`
- `BlockHeader.cliqueExtraVanity(): Buffer`
- `BlockHeader.cliqueExtraSeal(): Buffer`
- `BlockHeader.cliqueEpochTransitionSigners(): Address[]`
- `BlockHeader.cliqueVerifySignature(signerList: Address[]): boolean`
- `BlockHeader.cliqueSigner(): Address`

See the API docs for a detailed documentation. Note that these methods will throw if called in a non-Clique/PoA context.

### Other Changes

- The `Common` instance passed is now copied to avoid side-effects towards the outer common instance on HF updates, PR [#1089](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1089)
- Fixed a bug where txs have been created with the wrong HF when `hardforkByBlockNumber` is used along with the static constructors, PR [#1089](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1089)
- Fixed a bug where `Common` has not been passed to the returned block in the `blockFromRpc()` method, PR [#1032](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1032)

## 3.0.0 - 2020-11-24

### New Package Name

**Attention!** This new version is part of a series of EthereumJS releases all moving to a new scoped package name format. In this case the library is renamed as follows:

- `ethereumjs-block` -> `@ethereumjs/block`

Please update your library references accordingly or install with:

```shell
npm i @ethereumjs/block
```

### TypeScript/Library Import

This is the first TypeScript based release of the library, see PR [#72](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-block/pull/72).
The import structure has slightly changed along:

**TypeScript**

```typescript
import { BlockHeader } from 'ethereumjs-block'
import { Block } from 'ethereumjs-block'
```

**JavaScript/Node.js**

```javascript
const BlockHeader = require('ethereumjs-block').BlockHeader
const Block = require('ethereumjs-block').Block
```

The library now also comes with a **type declaration file** distributed along with the package published.

### Major Refactoring - Breaking Changes

This release is a major refactoring of the block library to simplify and strengthen its code base. Refactoring work has been done along PR [#72](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-block/pull/72) (Promises) and PR [#883](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/883) (refactoring of API and internal code structure).

#### New Constructor Params

The way to instantiate a new `BlockHeader` or `Block` object has been completely reworked and is now more explicit, less error prone and produces more `TypeScript` friendly and readable code.

The old direct constructor usage is now discouraged in favor of different dedicated static factory methods to create new objects.

**Breaking**: While the main constructors can still be called, signatures changed significantly and your old `new Block(...)`, `new BlockHeader(...)` instantiations won't work any more and needs to be updated.

**BlockHeader Class**

There are three new factory methods to create a new `BlockHeader`:

1. Pass in a Header-attribute named dictionary to `BlockHeader.fromHeaderData(headerData: HeaderData = {}, opts?: BlockOptions)`:

```typescript
const headerData = {
  number: 15,
  parentHash: '0x6bfee7294bf44572b7266358e627f3c35105e1c3851f3de09e6d646f955725a7',
  difficulty: 131072,
  gasLimit: 8000000,
  timestamp: 1562422144,
}
const header = BlockHeader.fromHeaderData(headerData)
```

2. Create a `BlockHeader` from an RLP-serialized header `Buffer` with `BlockHeader.fromRLPSerializedHeader(serialized: Buffer, opts: BlockOptions)`.

```typescript
const serialized = Buffer.from(
  'f901f7a06bfee7294bf44572b7266358e627f3c35105e1c3851f3de09e6d646f955725a7a01dcc4de8dec75d7aab85b567b6ccd41ad312451b948a7413f0a142fd40d49347940000000000000000000000000000000000000000a00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a056e81f171bcc55a6ff8345e692c0f86e5b48e01b996cadc001622fb5e363b421a056e81f171bcc55a6ff8345e692c0f86e5b48e01b996cadc001622fb5e363b421b9010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000830200000f837a120080845d20ab8080a00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000880000000000000000',
  'hex'
)
const header = BlockHeader.fromRLPSerializedHeader(serialized)
```

3. Create a `BlockHeader` from an array of `Buffer` values, you can do a first short roundtrip test with:

```typescript
const valuesArray = header.raw()
BlockHeader.fromValuesArray(valuesArray)
```

Generally internal types representing block header values are now closer to their domain representation (number, difficulty, gasLimit) instead of having everthing represented as a `Buffer`.

**Block Class**

There are analogue new static factories for the `Block` class:

- `Block.fromBlockData(blockData: BlockData = {}, opts?: BlockOptions)`
- `Block.fromRLPSerializedBlock(serialized: Buffer, opts?: BlockOptions)`
- `Block.fromValuesArray(values: BlockBuffer, opts?: BlockOptions)`

Learn more about the full API in the [docs](./docs/README.md).

#### Immutability

The returned block is now frozen and immutable. To work with a maliable block, copy it with `const fakeBlock = Object.create(block)`.

If you need `Block` mutability - e.g. because you want to subclass `Block` and modifiy its behavior - there is a `freeze` option to prevent the `Object.freeze()` call on initialization, see PR [#941](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/941).

#### Promise-based API

The API of this library is now completely promise-based and the old callback-style interface has been dropped.

This affects the following methods of the API now being defined as `async` and returning a `Promise`:

**Header Class**

- `BlockHeader.validate(blockchain: Blockchain, height?: BN): Promise<void>`

**Block Class**

- `Block.genTxTrie(): Promise<void>`
- `Block.validate(blockChain: Blockchain): Promise<void>`
- `Block.validateUncles(blockchain: Blockchain): Promise<void>`

Usage example:

```javascript
try {
  await block.validate(blockchain)
  // Block validation has passed
} catch (err) {
  // handle errors appropriately
}
```

### Header Validation Methods > Signature Changes

**Breaking**: The signatures of the following header validation methods have been updated to take a `parentBlockHeader` instead of a `parentBlock` input parameter for consistency and removing a circling dependency with `Block`:

- `BlockHeader.canonicalDifficulty(parentBlockHeader: BlockHeader): BN`
- `BlockHeader.validateDifficulty(parentBlockHeader: BlockHeader): boolean`
- `BlockHeader.validateGasLimit(parentBlockHeader: BlockHeader): boolean`

On the `Block` library new corresponding methods have been added which both operate on a block instance and expect a `parentBlock` as an input parameter.

**Breaking:** Note that `canonicalDifficulty()` and `validateDifficulty()` in block and header now throw on non-PoW chains, see PR [#937](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/937).

**Breaking:** Non-blockchain dependent validation checks have been extracted from `validate()` to its own `Block.validateData()` function. For the `validate()` method in block and header `blockchain` is now a mandatory parameter, see PR [#942](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/942)

### New Default Hardfork

**Breaking:** The default HF on the library has been updated from `petersburg` to `istanbul`, see PR [#906](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/906).

The HF setting is now automatically taken from the HF set for `Common.DEAULT_HARDFORK`, see PR [#863](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/863).

### Dual ES5 and ES2017 Builds

We significantly updated our internal tool and CI setup along the work on PR [#913](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/913) with an update to `ESLint` from `TSLint` for code linting and formatting and the introduction of a new build setup.

Packages now target `ES2017` for Node.js builds (the `main` entrypoint from `package.json`) and introduce a separate `ES5` build distributed along using the `browser` directive as an entrypoint, see PR [#921](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/921). This will result in performance benefits for Node.js consumers, see [here](https://github.com/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree/pull/117) for a releated discussion.

### Other Changes

**Features**

- Added `Block.genesis()` and `BlockHeader.genesis()` aliases to create a genesis block or header, PR [#883](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/883)
- Added `DAO` hardfork support (check for `extraData` attribute if `DAO` HF is active), PR [#843](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/843)
- Added the `calcDifficultyFromHeader` constructor option. If this `BlockHeader` is supplied, then the `difficulty` of the constructed `BlockHeader` will be set to the canonical difficulty (also if `difficulty` is set as parameter in the constructor). See [#929](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/929)
- Added full uncle validation, which verifies if the uncles' `parentHash` points to the canonical chain, is not yet included and also is an uncle and not a canonical block. See PR [#935](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/935)
- Additional consistency and validation checks in `Block.validateUncles()` for included uncle headers, PR [#935](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/935)

- **Breaking**: `Block.validateTransactions(stringError: true)` now returns a `string[]`, PR [#883](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/883)
- **Breaking**: Decoupling of the `Block.serialize()` and `Block.raw()` methods, `Block.serialize()` now always returns the RLP-encoded block (signature change!), `Block.raw()` always returns the pure `Buffer` array, PR [#883](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/883)
- **Breaking**: `Block.toJSON()` now always returns the labeled `JSON` representation, removal of the `labeled` function parameter, PR [#883](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/883)
- Updated `merkle-patricia-tree` dependency to `v4`, PR [#787](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/787)
- Updated `ethereumjs-util` dependency to `v7`, PR [#748](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/748)
- Removal of the `async` dependency, PR [#72](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-block/pull/72)

**CI and Testing**

const header = BlockHeader.fromRLPSerializedHeader(serialized)
```

3. Create a `BlockHeader` from an array of `Buffer` values, you can do a first short roundtrip test with:

```typescript
const valuesArray = header.raw()
BlockHeader.fromValuesArray(valuesArray)
```

Generally internal types representing block header values are now closer to their domain representation
(number, difficulty, gasLimit) instead of having everthing represented as a `Buffer`.

**Block Class**

There are analogue new static factories for the `Block` class:

- `Block.fromBlockData(blockData: BlockData = {}, opts?: BlockOptions)`
- `Block.fromRLPSerializedBlock(serialized: Buffer, opts?: BlockOptions)`
- `Block.fromValuesArray(values: BlockBuffer, opts?: BlockOptions)`

Learn more about the full API in the [docs](./docs/README.md).

#### Immutability

The returned block is now frozen and immutable. To work with a maliable block, copy it with `const fakeBlock = Object.create(block)`.

#### Promise-based API

The API of this library is now completely promise-based and the old callback-style interface
has been dropped.

This affects the following methods of the API now being defined as `async` and
returning a `Promise`:

**Header Class**

- `BlockHeader.validate(blockchain: Blockchain, height?: BN): Promise<void>`

**Block Class**

- `Block.genTxTrie(): Promise<void>`
- `Block.validate(blockChain: Blockchain): Promise<void>`
- `Block.validateUncles(blockchain: Blockchain): Promise<void>`

Usage example:

```javascript
try {
  await block.validate(blockchain)
  // Block validation has passed
} catch (err) {
  // handle errors appropriately
}
```

### Header Validation Methods > Signature Changes

**Breaking**: The signatures of the following header validation methods have been updated to take a `parentBlockHeader` instead of a
`parentBlock` input parameter for consistency and removing a circling dependency with `Block`:

- `BlockHeader.canonicalDifficulty(parentBlockHeader: BlockHeader): BN`
- `BlockHeader.validateDifficulty(parentBlockHeader: BlockHeader): boolean`
- `BlockHeader.validateGasLimit(parentBlockHeader: BlockHeader): boolean`

On the `Block` library new corresponding methods have been added which both operate on a block instance and expect a `parentBlock`
as an input parameter.

### New Default Hardfork

**Breaking:** The default HF on the library has been updated from `petersburg` to `istanbul`, see PR [#906](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/906).
The HF setting is now automatically taken from the HF set for `Common.DEAULT_HARDFORK`,
see PR [#863](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/863).

### Dual ES5 and ES2017 Builds

We significantly updated our internal tool and CI setup along the work on
PR [#913](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/913) with an update to `ESLint` from `TSLint`
for code linting and formatting and the introduction of a new build setup.

Packages now target `ES2017` for Node.js builds (the `main` entrypoint from `package.json`) and introduce
a separate `ES5` build distributed along using the `browser` directive as an entrypoint, see
PR [#921](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/921). This will result
in performance benefits for Node.js consumers, see [here](https://github.com/ethereumjs/merkle-patricia-tree/pull/117) for a releated discussion.

### Other Changes

**Features**

- Added `Block.genesis()` and `BlockHeader.genesis()` aliases to create
  a genesis block or header,
  PR [#883](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/883)
- Added `DAO` hardfork support (check for `extraData` attribute if `DAO` HF is active),
  PR [#843](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/843)
- Added the `calcDifficultyFromHeader` constructor option. If this `BlockHeader` is supplied, then the `difficulty` of the constructed `BlockHeader` will be set to the canonical difficulty (also if `difficulty` is set as parameter in the constructor). See [#929](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/929)

**Changes and Refactoring**

- Added Node `10`, `12` support, dropped Node `7` support,
  PR [#72](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-block/pull/72)
- Passing in a blockchain is now optional on `Block.validate()`,
  PR [#883](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/883)
- **Breaking**: `Block.validateTransactions(stringError: true)` now returns a `string[]`,
  PR [#883](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/883)
- **Breaking**: Decoupling of the `Block.serialize()` and `Block.raw()` methods,
  `Block.serialize()` now always returns the RLP-encoded block (signature change!),
  `Block.raw()` always returns the pure `Buffer` array,
  PR [#883](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/883)
- **Breaking**: `Block.toJSON()` now always returns the labeled `JSON` representation,
  removal of the `labeled` function parameter,

## [2.0.0] - 2018-06-25

This release introduces both support for different `chains` (`mainnet`, `ropsten`, ...)
and `hardforks` up to the latest applied HF (`byzantium`). Parameters and genesis values
are provided by the new [ethereumjs-common](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-common)
library which also defines the set of supported chains and forks.

Changes in detail:

- New initialization parameters `opts.chain` (default: `mainnet`) and `opts.hardfork`
  (default: `null`, block number-based behaviour), PR [#44](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-block/pull/44)
- Alternatively a `Common` class object can be provided directly with the `opts.common` parameter,
  see [API](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/blob/master/packages/block/docs/index.md) docs
- Correct block validation for all know hardforks, PR
  [#47](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-block/pull/47), if no hardfork is set validation logic
  is determined by block number in combination with the `chain` set
- Genesis block initialization depending on the `chain` set (see `ethereumjs-common` for supported chains)
- Extensive test additions to cover the newly introduced capabilities and changes
- Fix default value for `nonce` (empty buffer -> `<Buffer 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00>`), PR [#42](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-block/pull/42)
