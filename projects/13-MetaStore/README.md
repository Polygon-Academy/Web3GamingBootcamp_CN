Only the owners of MetaStore can put nft on line and sell them. matic is the currency in PolygonStore. Newly unlocked shops need to buy matics.

## Architecture
metaStore is a meta store built on top of polygon. Store owners have the right to make, distribute, and sell NFT products, the equivalent of Amazon on Polygon. The Store owner will manage the Store. Artists and NFT producers can use the Store to publish their work without any central point of approval.
