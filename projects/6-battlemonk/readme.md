Project Introduction：
Battle Monk is a turn-based auto- fight game.
The players need to fight with all kind of monsters in a mystery tower, and get to the higher level.
By defeat the monsters of each level, the player will gain bulk of rewards.
And the character will keep fighting in the tower and earn fortunes even after the player log out.
As long as the character keep growing stronger, the player can participate the arena and venture map to get more profits.
And unlock more systems in the game.
And one of our goal is to lower the threshold as much as we can.
To play our game, you don't have to cost nearly nothing to get start.
